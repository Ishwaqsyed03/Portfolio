name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# IMPORTANT: For this to work properly, make sure GitHub Pages is configured to:
# 1. Source: GitHub Actions (not "Deploy from a branch")
# 2. Go to repo Settings > Pages > Source > select "GitHub Actions"
# 
# If you see README content instead of the portfolio:
# - Check that GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"  
# - The live link should be: https://username.github.io/Portfolio/
